# Creating and maintaining a sustainable lifestyle

Sustainability goals are becoming more defined in various industries. Often, consumers like the idea of purchasing sustainable products and maintaining an overall sustainable lifestyle but are unsure of where to find quality sustainable products and clothing. If consumers do know where to look, sometimes price or accessibility can deter them from shopping sustainably. This app will focus on making these resources more accessible and mainstream so that everyone may enjoy these products and create a movement towards sustainability in our everyday lives.

The app will target environmentally conscious consumers who want to make sustainable choices and brands looking to market their sustainable products. Additionally, this app will also have a focus on sustainable, good quality, and beautiful clothing for those looking to steer away from fast fashion brands that saturate the market.

This project currently focuses on accessibility to sustainable products, with no current restrictions on the retail stores in which these products may be purchased (i.e. the product may be sustainable, but may be purchasable from a retail company that does not meet certain sustainability requirements.)

This project is a part of the Microsoft Global Hackathon 2024.
